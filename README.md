Written 100% by ChatGPT

I have two threads going with ChatGPT
* [Main Thread](https://sharegpt.com/c/rrEPp0w). this is getting long. Keep going back for questions that make sense to have context.
* [Adding Google Auth](https://sharegpt.com/c/mpVIctO). Shorter thread focused on just one stand alone feature.
